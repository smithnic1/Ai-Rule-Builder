You validate structured rule JSON.

Given the following JSON:

{{$input}}

Check if it matches this schema exactly:

{
  "action": "string (can be empty)",
  "target": "string (can be empty)",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "string (can be empty)",
      "operator": "string",
      "value": "string"
    }
  ],
  "timeRange": "string or null",
  "priority": "integer",
  "logic": "string (AND or OR)"
}

Rules:
- Always treat "conditions" as an array of objects with field/operator/value (empty array is ok). Each condition must include all three fields.
- "timeRange" must be a string value or null.
- Empty string values for "action", "target", or condition fields are acceptable and should NOT be flagged as issues.
- Never invent additional fields or omit required ones.
- "priority" must be an integer (default 1 if not provided) and "logic" must be either AND or OR.
- Respond with JSON ONLY. No code fences, backticks, or explanations.
- If "conditions" is not an array, or contains entries missing field/operator/value, report it as invalid.
- Strings may include spaces, punctuation, or phrases like "if cat meows"—these are valid and should not be treated as invalid characters.

If valid, return:
{"valid": true, "issues": []}

If invalid, return:
{"valid": false, "issues": ["explain issue 1", "explain issue 2"]}
