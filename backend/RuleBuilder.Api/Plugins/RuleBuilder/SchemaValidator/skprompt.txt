You validate structured rule JSON.

Given the following JSON:

{{$input}}

Check if it matches this schema exactly:

{
  "action": "string (can be empty)",
  "target": "string (can be empty)",
  "constraints": ["string", ... zero or more items],
  "timeRange": "string or null"
}

Rules:
- Always treat "constraints" as an array of strings (empty array is ok).
- "timeRange" must be a string value or null.
- Empty string values for "action" or "target" are acceptable and should NOT be flagged as issues.
- Never invent additional fields or omit required ones.
- Respond with JSON ONLY. No code fences, backticks, or explanations.
- Strings may include spaces, punctuation, or phrases like "if cat meows"—these are valid and should not be treated as invalid characters.

If valid, return:
{"valid": true, "issues": []}

If invalid, return:
{"valid": false, "issues": ["explain issue 1", "explain issue 2"]}
